# GSS Client - Gamified Social Sports Platform

## 🚨 FIRST-TIME AGENT? START HERE

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:** Read [`docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`](docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md) completely.

### Quick Context

- **Project Type:** Frontend-only implementation (React Native + React web)
- **Backend Status:** Complete and available via APIs
- **Frontend Status:** Greenfield implementation needed
- **Current Progress:** Check [`docs/sprint-status.yaml`](docs/sprint-status.yaml)

### 🚨 CRITICAL - AGENTS ALWAYS GET THIS WRONG

**❌ WRONG:** "Epic 4/5/6 have tech specs in docs/shared/tech-specs/ so they're contexted"  
**✅ CORRECT:** "`docs/shared/` are BACKEND reference docs only. Only `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` exists for frontend"

### Key Documents

1. **[`docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`](docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md)** - 🚨 **MANDATORY READ** - Complete project understanding
2. **[`docs/AGENT-CHECKLIST.md`](docs/AGENT-CHECKLIST.md)** - 🚨 **QUICK REFERENCE** - Prevent common mistakes
3. **[`docs/sprint-status.yaml`](docs/sprint-status.yaml)** - Current development status
4. **[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)** - Frontend architecture decisions
5. **[`docs/shared/`](docs/shared/)** - Backend reference documents (READ-ONLY)

### For AI Agents

**Context Preservation:** All critical project context is saved in `docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`. If you're confused about project status or scope, read that file first.

**Sprint Management:** Current work status is tracked in `docs/sprint-status.yaml` - update this as work progresses.

**Backend Integration:** Use `docs/shared/` files as API contract references, but remember the backend is already implemented. Your job is frontend client implementation.

**Need Help?** Start with `docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` - it answers all common questions about project structure and agent handoffs.
