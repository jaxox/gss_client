# 🚨 MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS: Read docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md COMPLETELY before any work
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: This is FRONTEND-ONLY implementation. Backend APIs are complete and separate.
# 📖 Context lost between agent sessions? Always check docs/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md first!
# 🛑 AGENTS ALWAYS MAKE THIS MISTAKE: docs/shared/tech-specs/ are BACKEND reference only!
# 🎯 ONLY docs/tech-spec-epic-X.md files count for frontend contexted status!

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created (required before drafting stories)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Under SM review (via code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically drafts next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
