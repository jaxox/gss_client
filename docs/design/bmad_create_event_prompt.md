# BMAD Designer Prompt --- Redesign the Create Event Flow (4 Steps)

## Goal

Redesign the entire 4-step "Create Event" flow into a **modern, premium,
2025-style mobile experience**.\
The current design is functional but feels **plain, stock, and boxy**. I
want it to look **high-end, clean, intentional, and visually
delightful**, similar to top-tier apps like Airbnb, ClassPass,
Headspace, and Strava.

Keep the same flow and fields --- just elevate the visual system.

---

## Overall Style Direction

- Modern 2025 UI\
- Clean, airy, and polished\
- Better spacing rhythm, tighter paddings\
- Softer depth, subtle shadows (no heavy borders)\
- Rounded corners but balanced\
- Smooth gradient accents used sparingly\
- High-quality icons\
- Clear hierarchy: headline → section → input\
- A consistent "card system" across all steps\
- Motion-friendly layout (slide transitions, micro-interactions)

---

## Fix / Improve These Areas

### 1. Header + Step Indicator

- Current header looks generic\
- Make it feel premium and integrated\
- Step indicator should feel more animated, smoother, and visually
  modern\
- Possibly use a progress bar or a segmented bar with better spacing
  and color usage

### 2. Section Headers

- "Basic Information", "Location & Time", "Event Details", etc. should
  feel more designed\
- Add stronger hierarchy through typography + spacing\
- Consider subtle dividers or cards for grouping

### 3. Input Fields

Right now they look flat and stock.

Improve with:\

- Softer borders or filled variants\
- Better contrast\
- Better icons and alignment\
- More consistent padding inside fields\
- Cleaner label hierarchy\
- Polished focus states

### 4. Sport Selection Area

This part needs a full redesign.\
Currently looks like basic buttons.

Improvement direction:\

- Icon cards with shadows or frosted-glass feel\
- Better active state styling\
- More modern iconography\
- Maybe a horizontal scroll chip system

### 5. Buttons

- "Cancel" and "Next" need stronger visual treatment\
- Increase clarity of primary vs secondary actions\
- More rounded, polished surfaces\
- Consider subtle gradients or depth

### 6. Payment Details Section

This is busy and visually heavy.\
Improve by:\

- Grouping items into cards\
- Using cleaner list styles\
- Adding spacing between payment methods\
- Making radio selections more modern

### 7. Co-Hosts & Links Section

Currently floating in whitespace.\
Create a clear card + icon pattern so it feels intentional.

### 8. Review & Publish Screen

This is the most visually important but currently the most
stock-looking.\
Improve with:\

- Stronger summary card design\
- Better color coding for sections\
- Iconography with more personality\
- Better layout for payment methods\
- Visual grouping of sections (When / Where / Details / Host)

## Deliverables

Provide **2--3 design explorations** for the entire Create Event flow,
including:\

1. Header + step indicator redesign\
2. A consistent card/component visual system\
3. New input field and selection styles\
4. A polished sport selector\
5. Modernized buttons, toggles, and chip components\
6. A refined Review & Publish summary card\
7. A short explanation for why each version works

Focus on creating a cohesive, premium experience that feels modern,
minimal, and professional.
