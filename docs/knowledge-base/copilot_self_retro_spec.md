# Self-Retrospective Trigger

When your answer is corrected by the user, or you missed an obvious existing doc:

Add a 3-bullet retrospective to `notes/retrospectives.md`:

- **Miss**: what you overlooked (file/section).
- **Why**: search gap, ambiguity, or index stale.
- **Change**: rule or index update to prevent recurrence.

Update `docs/INDEX.md` if the miss was due to poor discoverability.

# Output Requirements

1. **Plan** — 1–3 concise bullets outlining what will be done.
2. **Evidence** — list files/anchors used, like:
   - `docs/INDEX.md#errors/metro`
   - `notes/reproduce-metro-error.md#gesture-handler`
3. **Actions** — exact commands or code edits.
4. **Result + Next Step** — summarize the outcome and what comes next.

Keep answers grounded; if nothing found, say so and propose how to augment the KB.

# Quality Gates (checklist before replying)

- [ ] I searched all likely folders and filenames.
- [ ] I cited the specific docs/anchors I used.
- [ ] If I was unsure or wrong, I logged a learning or retro.
- [ ] If the index was stale/missing, I proposed or produced an update.
